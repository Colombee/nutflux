#Project

Project made in react.js. Exercise proposed at the 7th month of training at BeCode.
On the basis of a react.js course, I had to develop a "Netflix" alone.


## Realization

Done alone.

Each step such as additions of components is achieved by sprints of 2 to 3 days.

A the beginning :
- css file with some properties already established
- database (json file)

  <summary>Installed components</summary>
npm install --save react-router-dom
</details>
